            <h2>ðŸ§  About</h2>
            <p>This project was created by Jennifer Lee to share real-world teaching strategies and promote intentional, ethical AI use in the classroom.</p>
            <hr>
            
            <!-- Subsection: Why the project was created -->
            <h3>ðŸ”Ž Why This Project Was Created</h3>
            <p>The rise of AI in education prompted a need for intentional, student-centered teaching strategies. GitHub Copilot is powerful, but it requires thoughtful scaffolding, reflection, and structure to become a tool for learningâ€”not a shortcut.</p>

            <!-- Subsection: Philosophy behind the project -->
            <h3>ðŸ’¡ Philosophy</h3>
            <p>This project is built on the belief that AI tools like Copilot should <strong>amplify</strong> teaching, not replace it. Used intentionally, Copilot can support creativity, collaboration, and curiosity.</p>
            <p>Educators are invited to adapt, remix, and share. Together, we can shape a future where AI and education coexist with purpose and integrity.</p>
