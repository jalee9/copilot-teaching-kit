            <h2>üíª AI Coding Tools Policy (e.g., GitHub Copilot)</h2>
            <p>In this course, students are permitted to use AI-assisted coding tools such as <strong>GitHub Copilot</strong> under the following conditions:</p>
            <ul>
                <!-- Guidelines for using Copilot responsibly -->
                <li><strong>‚úÖ Review and Revise</strong><br>
                    You must review, understand, and revise any code suggestions before using them in assignments.
                </li>
                <li><strong>‚úÖ Academic Integrity</strong><br>
                    You are responsible for ensuring that all submitted work aligns with course outcomes and the college‚Äôs academic integrity policy.
                </li>
                <li><strong>‚úÖ Annotate Copilot Use</strong><br>
                    All AI-generated code must be clearly annotated in your comments.<br>
                    Example: <code>// Suggested by GitHub Copilot and modified</code>
                </li>
                <li><strong>‚ö†Ô∏è Understand Your Code</strong><br>
                    Over-reliance on Copilot without demonstrating understanding may negatively impact your grade and your ability to succeed in future coursework.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <hr>
            <!-- Reminder about responsible Copilot use -->
            <p><strong>üì£ Remember:</strong><br>
                Copilot can be a helpful learning partner, but it does not replace your role as the coder. Use it to <strong>enhance</strong> your thinking, not <strong>bypass</strong> it.

            <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
            <p>Without structure, students may:</p>
            <ul>
                <!-- Risks of unstructured Copilot use -->
                <li>Over-rely on AI-generated code</li>

                <li>Miss opportunities to build independent confidence</li>
